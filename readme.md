# MP3 Converter

This is a simple MP3 Converter that converts MP4-files to MP3-files by simply drag-and-dropping them in the specified folder.

It is build using the Moviepy Library to convert the files and deployed with Docker, so it can keep running in the background to check for new files.

The purpose of this Project was to learn how to use Docker.
